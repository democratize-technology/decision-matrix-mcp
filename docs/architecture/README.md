# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records for the Decision Matrix MCP project. ADRs document significant architectural decisions, their context, and consequences.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) are documents that capture important architectural decisions made along with their context and consequences. They serve as a historical record of why certain design choices were made.

## ADR Lifecycle

1. **Proposed** - Initial draft under discussion
2. **Accepted** - Decision approved and being implemented
3. **Deprecated** - Decision no longer recommended but still in use
4. **Superseded** - Replaced by a newer decision (reference the superseding ADR)

## How to Create an ADR

1. Copy the `template.md` file
2. Name it `ADR-XXX-short-title.md` (where XXX is the next sequential number)
3. Fill in all sections thoroughly
4. Submit for review before marking as "Accepted"

## Current ADRs

| ADR | Title | Status | Date |
|-----|-------|--------|------|
| [001](ADR-001-backend-strategy-pattern.md) | Backend Strategy Pattern | Accepted | 2025-08-12 |
| [002](ADR-002-service-layer-architecture.md) | Service Layer Architecture | Accepted | 2025-08-12 |
| [003](ADR-003-dependency-injection-container.md) | Dependency Injection Container | Accepted | 2025-08-12 |
| [004](ADR-004-session-management-strategy.md) | Session Management Strategy | Accepted | 2025-08-12 |
| [005](ADR-005-structured-response-parsing.md) | Structured Response Parsing | Accepted | 2025-08-12 |

## Guidelines

### Writing ADRs

- **Be concise but complete** - Include all necessary context without excessive detail
- **Focus on the "why"** - Decisions are more important than implementation details
- **Consider the future** - Think about how this decision will age
- **Include alternatives** - Show that other options were considered
- **Be honest about trade-offs** - Document both positive and negative consequences

### When to Write an ADR

Write an ADR when making decisions that:
- Affect the overall architecture or design philosophy
- Have significant impact on future development
- Involve trade-offs between multiple valid approaches
- Are likely to be questioned or revisited later
- Set precedents for similar future decisions

### ADR Review Process

1. Create draft ADR with status "Proposed"
2. Share with team for review and discussion
3. Incorporate feedback and update the ADR
4. Mark as "Accepted" when consensus is reached
5. Update status to "Deprecated" or "Superseded" if decision changes
